[*Native Climate*](https://native-climate.com) is a USDA NIFA-funded project to support climate
adaptation efforts in Native American communities by building new
connections between Native wisdom and Western scientific data. Through
two-way information-sharing and relationship-building, Native Climate
aims to make climate data more accessible and useful to Tribes, and to
build awareness nationally about climate impacts and resilience on
Native lands. The project is led by the Desert Research Institute in
partnership with University of Nevada, Reno Tribal Extension, the
Montana Climate Office at the University of Montana, University of
Arizona Tribal Extension, and the USDA Climate Hubs. The project team
includes Tribal natural resource managers, agriculture producers, and
climate leaders along with 1994 and 1862 Tribal Extension, researchers
working in Indian Country, other federal and state climate service
organizations, and a group of Native American advisors. *Native Climate*
is funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institute of
Food and Agriculture (USDA NIFA) and builds on the work of the [Native
Waters on Arid Lands](https://nativewaters-aridlands.com/) project
(2015–2022).

Native Climate partners at the Montana Climate Office have extracted
place-based climate data for Native American, Alaska Native, and Native
Hawaiian lands located in the United States. Climate data and
projections for temperature, precipitation, and other metrics related to
crop, livestock and forestry agriculture are shown in the accompanying
graphs. The data derive from eight Coupled Model Intercomparison Project
Phase 6 (CMIP6) global climate models and four socioeconomic scenarios
for the period from 2015 to 2100, as well as the historical simulation
for each model for the period 1950 to 2014. Raw data are extracted for
the location of the reservation from the NASA Earth Exchange (NEX)
Global Daily Downscaled Projections (GDDP) dataset (NEX-GDDP-CMIP6).
Further information on the NASA NEX downscaled product, including
descriptions of the projected climate variables, can be found at
<https://www.nccs.nasa.gov/services/data-collections/land-based-products/nex-gddp-cmip6>.

Spatial data on Native lands were derived from the US Census TIGER/Line
database, which includes all tribally controlled lands in the United
States, as well as Alaska Native Village Statistical Areas (ANVSA) and
State Designated Tribal Statistical Areas (SDTSA). We divided the Navajo
Nation into its five agencies to better represent climate differences
across the Nation. We used the recently defined climate divisions for
the State of Hawai‘i ([Luo et al
2024](https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/105/6/BAMS-D-23-0236.1.xml))
to represent climate difference on the Hawaiian Islands.

Tabular data for all graphs included here are available in the
accompanying Microsoft Excel workbook. We aggregated daily data from
each model and scenario into seasonal or annual statistics (the **Annual
Projections** worksheet), and then we combined the results from the
eight models using a generalized additive model (the **Smoothed
Projections** worksheet). We provide raw daily data for each scenario in
the **Raw** worksheets.

The CMIP6 data include projections for four scenarios for how global
society, demographics and economics might change over the next century,
collectively called “Shared Socioeconomic Pathways” (SSPs). The SSPs
offer pathways that the world could take in the future and are used in
conjunction with the “Representative Concentration Pathways” (RCPs) for
greenhouse gas emissions that were included in previous CMIP
projections.

The following scenarios are included in these data:

> **SSP1-2.6** This is a best-case scenario. Global CO<sub>2</sub>
> emissions are cut severely, reaching net-zero after 2050. Societies
> switch to more sustainable practices, with focus shifting from
> economic growth to overall well-being. Investments in education and
> health go up, and inequality falls. Temperatures stabilize around 1.8
> ºC higher by the end of the century.
>
> **SSP2-4.5** This is a “middle of the road” scenario. CO<sub>2</sub>
> emissions hover around current levels before starting to fall
> mid-century, but do not reach net-zero by 2100. Socioeconomic factors
> follow their historic trends, with no notable shifts. Progress toward
> sustainability is slow, with development and income growing unevenly.
> In this scenario, temperatures rise 2.7 ºC by the end of the century.
>
> **SSP3-7.0** On this path, emissions and temperatures rise steadily
> and CO<sub>2</sub> emissions roughly double from current levels by
> 2100. Countries become more competitive with one another, shifting
> toward national security and ensuring their own food supplies. By the
> end of the century, average temperatures have risen by 3.6 ºC.
>
> **SSP5-8.5** This can be considered a worst-case scenario. Current
> CO<sub>2</sub> emissions levels roughly double by 2050. The global
> economy grows quickly, but this growth is fueled by exploiting fossil
> fuels and energy-intensive lifestyles. By 2100, the average global
> temperature is 4.4 ºC higher.
